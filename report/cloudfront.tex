\section{Introduction}
Amazon CloudFront is service that provides a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a geographically wide network of computer nodes that makes it possible to distribute content to end users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. As of November 2014, Amazon CloudFront has edge locations in all continents except Africa and Antarctica. Most of them reside in USA, Europe and Asia \cite{CloudFront_product_details}.

This research aims to achieve a better understanding of how files propagate within Amazon CloudFront after a CloudFront distribution is created.  Multiple files of different sizes are made available through Amazon CloudFront and for these files the network latency and retrieval latency were measured from different, geographically spread-out locations at multiple times after initiating the CloudFront distribution. Here, the retrieval latency is the time from the first HTTP GET request until the first response packet that contains data.

\section{Experiment setup}
To setup the required cloud services, Amazon S3 buckets were created for each available location: US East, US West (Oregon), US West (California), Ireland, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo. The S3 buckets functioned as storages for the files to be downloaded via CloudFront. Then, for each of those buckets, we created a CloudFront download distribution. Thus, all CDN download distributions had their own S3 origin in the same region. All download distributions were set to use only HTTP and to be available at all edge locations. Finally, five different-sized files were uploaded to each S3 bucket. The sizes were 1KB, 10KB, 100KB, 1MB, and 10MB. These files were made using rdfc, a Windows utility to make random binary data files of specific sizes.

\section{Measurements}
To capture how files of different sizes propagate through Amazon's CloudFront CDN network, we measured the network latency to the different CloudFront servers as well as the retrieval latency for each of the files at intervals of one hour starting after initializing the CloudFront distributions and continuing for approximately twenty measurements. These measurements were made from a home computer (located in Finland) and from Amazon EC2 instances in California, Ireland and Singapore.


Since we had 9 different S3 locations, 5 different file sizes, about 20 different measurement times, and 4 different measuring locations, there were numerous combinations. To automate things, we wrote a Bash script that performs the measurements and ran it as a cron job. About hourly, the script pings 10 times all the CloudFront distributions and downloads all the files, taking tshark log at the same time, and puts the outputs to files. After running this from each measuring location, we ended up having a file structure as follows:\\

\dirtree{%
.1 d2dx94olpiqj0t.CloudFront.net.
.2 california.
.3 1kb.
.4 1kb\_19.11-17.40.txt.
.4 1kb\_19.11-18.40.txt.
.4 ....
.3 10kb.
.3 100kb.
.3 1mb.
.3 10mb.
.3 1kb.
.3 ping\_19.11-17.40.txt.
.3 ping\_19.11-18.40.txt.
.3 ....
.2 home.
.3 ....
.2 ireland.
.3 ....
.2 singapore.
.3 ....
.1 d3kjdkfj34jfd.CloudFront.net.
.2 ....
.1 ....
}

To extract interesting information from the data, a Bash script was created. It loops over all the files and builds up a CSV file containing columns shown in Table \ref{table:extracteddata}. The IP addresses are taken from the first HTTP response packet in tshark logs of the 10mb download. The network latencies are averages of the 10 pings. Retrieval latencies are taken from tshark logs - they are the durations between the first HTTP GET requests and the first HTTP response packets.

\section{Results}
Network latencies were visualized in \autoref{fig:pings}. For every measurement location, three download distribution from different continents were used: California, Ireland, and Tokyo. From home, network latency, with a couple exceptions, is 40-50 milliseconds. The network latencies measured from EC2s in California and Singapore are really small. Against all distributions, California's latencies are mainly less then one milliseconds and Singapore's vary mostly between 0.6 and 1.6 milliseconds. From Ireland EC2, however, network latencies keep fluctuating from ~1.5 milliseconds to ~85 milliseconds, back and forth.\\

Retrieval latencies are quite different if compared between measurement locations. They are, however, quite same when comparing against different download distributions from certain measurement location (See \autoref{fig:retrievals_california}, \autoref{fig:retrievals_ireland}, \autoref{fig:retrievals_tokyo}. From home, retrieval latencies fluctuate around 30 milliseconds, regardless of download distribution. From California and Singapore, retrieval latencies are mostly less than one millisecond (See \autoref{fig:retrievals_ireland_subset}, for example). Ireland, in turn, has quite interesting retrieval times. They seem to follow a zigzag pattern to some extend. Against download distribution in Ireland itself, the retrieval times frequently jump to ~90 milliseconds for two successive measurements, and then drop back to about one millisecond for some hours (measurements).

% It is trivial that both RTT and download time are lower for uncongested networks than for congested networks in every case.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
